This project was inspired by my needs and historio.us.  I hope to have a bookmark archiver by the time I'm finished.  Think something like Shaarli but with users AND an archive.  We'll see how it goes.

I plan to have 4 phases:

1 -- installer done
  here, I plan to have written all the initialization and database creation code.  This will be complete with support for multi users, etc...

2 -- take a URL and keep a text copy of a web page
  At this point, I just want to keep the text elements of the page.  I'll probably filter some things out (like javascript, etc….).  I'd also like to sort out adds, etc...

3 -- do something with images
  by this point, I'll have sorted out what I want to do with images on the page.  Who knows if I'll blob them into the database or if I'll store them on the filesystem somehow

4 -- other binary data (youtube videos, binaries, and the like)

If you have any comments, suggestions, etc… contact me.
